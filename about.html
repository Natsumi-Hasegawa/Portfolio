<div class="bio">
<h2> She is a recent graduate from Fordham University (2019) and she graduated with a BA: New Media and Digital Design. This is her portfolio that she has coded with HTML & CSS. Her passion is photography and web design and she decided to put those two together! 
<br>
<br>
She hopes that whoever views her photos can get some sense of peace and evoke a certain type of emotion out of them. Her interest in photography started when she was in early high school, as she stared out her windown everyday. There was something about the sunset and the way the sunlight trickled down the leaves that made her want to capture those moments and remember it forever. Memories fade and photos do not- at least not as quickly as memories do. </h2>
